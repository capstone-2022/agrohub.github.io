AgroHub

# What is AgroHub?
AgroHub is a marketplace for Puertorrican farmers. 

# What is our mission?
Our goal is to allow individual farmers and small organizations grow
economically and to scale up as much as they can in order to provide 
by selling their products via the Internet. In addition, we'd like to 
provide the community of Puerto Rico quality agricultural products. 

# Current Situation
Individual Farmers can only sell at certain times, since agricultural products
require high maintenance. Also, supermarkets and other chains require a high
production-rate that individual Farmers cannot meet. Given this, a new strategy
is rising, in which a group of Farmers act as a single entity or Organization 
with resources like storage, refrigeration, maintenance, etc. and *buy* the products
from other individual Farmers in order to redistribute. However, the
redistribution process requires tons of effort, e.g. determining how much a
single Farmer sold, scaling for more customers, etc.
